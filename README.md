# Fiber Go Boilerplate

Is a production-ready golang based boilerplate application with Fiber Go web framework.
For any fiber go application, just clone the repo & rename the application name.

[Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) is an Express.js inspired web framework build on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. Designed to ease things up for **fast** development with **zero memory allocation** and **performance** in mind.

## üóÑ Project structure

### /app

**Folder with business logic only**. This directory doesn't care about what database driver you're using.

- `/app/controller` folder for functional controller (used in routes)
- `/app/schema` folder for object for API clients
- `/app/model` folder for describe business models and methods of your project

### /cmd
**Main applications for this project.**

The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to have (e.g., `/cmd/server` `/cmd/cron`).
Don't put a lot of code in the application directory. If you think the code can be imported and used in other projects,
then it should live in the `/pkg` directory.

### /docs

**Folder with API Documentation.**

This directory contains config files for auto-generated API Docs by Swagger, screenshots
and any other documents related to this project.

### /pkg

**Folder with project-specific functionality.** This directory contains all the project-specific code tailored only for your business use case.

- `/pkg/config` folder for configuration functions
- `/pkg/middleware` folder for add middleware (Fiber built-in and yours)
- `/pkg/route` folder for describe routes of your project
- `/pkg/validator` folder with validation functions

### /platform

**Folder with platform-level logic**. This directory contains all the platform-level logic that will build up the actual project,
like setting up the database, logger instance.

- `/platform/database` folder with database setup functions (by default, Sqlite)
- `/platform/logger` folder with better logger setup functions (by default, Logrus)
